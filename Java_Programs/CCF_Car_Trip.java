// Output
// Input
// 5
// 800
// 3
// 299
// 301
// 300

// Output
// 8000
// 3000
// 3000
// 3010
// 3000

// Explanation:
// Test case 11: The car runs for 800 kms. Thus, he needs to pay 800* 10
// =8000 rupees.

// Test case 2: The car runs for 3 kms. However, since Chef booked the car for
// whole day, he needs to pay for at least 300300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
// 300* 10 = 3000 rupees.

// Test case 3: The car runs for 299 kms. However, since Chef booked the car
// for whole day, he needs to pay for at least 300300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
// 300â‹…10=3000 rupees.

// Test case 4: The car runs for 301 kms. Thus, he needs to pay 301* 10
// =3010 rupees.

// Test case 55: The car runs for 300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay 300* 10
// =3000 rupees.

// Explanation :
// Chef rented a car for a day.Usually, the cost of the car is Rs 1010 per km.
// However, since Chef has booked the car for the whole day, he needs to pay for
// at least 300300 kms even if the car runs less than 300300 kms.
// If the car ran XX kms, determine the cost Chef needs to pay.
